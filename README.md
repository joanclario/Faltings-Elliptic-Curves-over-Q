Let G be the Q-isogeny graph attached to an elliptic curve defined over Q.
Stevens shows that there is a unique elliptic curve in G with minimal Faltings height. 
We call this curve the Faltings elliptic curve in G.

For every square-free integer d, we consider the graph G^d
attached to the twisted elliptic curves in G 
by the quadratic character of Q(\sqrt{d}).

In this paper we determine which vertex is the Faltings elliptic curve in G^d. 
We also obtain the probability of a vertex to be the Faltings elliptic curve in G^d.
